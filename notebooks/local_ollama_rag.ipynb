This charging pad is designed to wirelessly charge your Qi ®  enabled mobile phone. Qi ®  is a standard that allows wireless charging of your mobile phone.\\nYour mobile phone must be designed for Qi ®  wireless charging. If the phone is not equipped with Qi ®  wireless charging functionality, an aftermarket sleeve or a specialized back plate can be purchased from your mobile phone provider or a local electronics retailer. Please see your phone’s Owner’s Manual for further information.\\nThe wireless charging pad is equipped with an anti-slip mat, a cradle to hold your mobile phone in place, and an LED indicator light.\\nPlace the device inside the prepared area delimited in the mat as shown in the image. Incorrect positioning will prevent the phone from charging.\\nNOTE:\\nIf your vehicle comes with a Wireless Charging pad, you\\'ll notice a clear indication on the rubber mat with the text \"Wireless Charger\" and accompanying phone and charging icon graphics. The charger is available on the left side for single charging pads, and on the left and right side for dual charging pads.\\nAlternatively, if you have a phone holder in your vehicle, it has a rubber surface with textured grip for secure placement, and a designated slot for your charging cord.\\nLED Indicator Status:\\n● No Light: Charging pad is idle or searching for a device. Device may not be compatible with the Qi ® standard.\\n● Blue Light: Device is detected and is charging.\\n● Red Light/Flashing: Internal error, or foreign object is detected.\\n● Green Light: Device has completed battery charging (if device is equipped to transmit this information).\\nImportant Notes Regarding This Vehicle’s Wireless Charging Pad:\\n● The presence of the Near-Field Communication (NFC) function active on a smartphone could signal malfunction anomalies.\\n● The ignition must be in the ON/RUN position in order for the phone to charge.\\n● To avoid interference with the key fob search, the wireless charging pad will stop charging when any\\ndoor or liftgate is opened, even if the engine is running.\\n● Be sure to place the mobile device correctly (display facing upward, and phone not covering the LED) on the wireless charging pad.\\n● If the phone moves on the pad causing the red light to illuminate, the phone will have to be picked up and placed back on the charging pad to resume charging.\\n● Wireless charging is not as fast as when the phone is connected to a wired charger.\\n● The phone’s protective case must be removed when placed on the wireless charging pad.\\n● iPhone ®  12 (including iPod ® ) is equipped with software to protect the device from overheating. When the software is active, the rate of charge is slowed down to protect the device.\\n● Phones must always be placed on the wireless charging pad within the outline shown on the pad so that its charging parts connect with the charging coils of the system. Movement of the phone during charging may prevent or slow the rate of charge.\\n● Having multiple applications open on the phone while charging will reduce the charging efficiency, and may even shut down an application that is actively running (i.e. Apple CarPlay ® ). This may also cause the phone to overheat.\\n● Wireless chargers may implement certain methods to prevent the phone from overheating during charging such as slowing down the rate of charge. In certain instances, the device may shut down for a brief period of time (when the device reaches a certain temperature). If this happens, it does not mean there is a fault with the wireless charging pad.This may just be a protective measure to prevent damage to the phone.\\n● The use of multiple wireless functions at the same time (wireless charging, Apple CarPlay ® , Android Auto ™ ) could cause the device to overheat, resulting in limitation of the functions or it turning off. In this case, it is recommended to connect the system using the USB port.\\n● Do not place the key fob or any other type of metal/ magnetized object inside the mobile phone housing or near the wireless charging pad.\\n● With a compatible device placed on the charging pad, and the ignition is cycled to the OFF position, a reminder message may appear on the instrument cluster display to warn the driver.\\n\\nThe key fob should not be placed on the charging pad or within 6 inches (15 cm) of it. Doing so can cause excessive heat buildup and damage to the fob. Placing the fob in close proximity of the charging pad blocks the fob from being detected by the vehicle and prevents the vehicle from starting.'),\n",

When the software is active, the rate of charge is slowed down to protect the device.\\n● Phones must always be placed on the wireless charging pad within the outline shown on the pad so that its charging parts connect with the charging coils of the system. Movement of the phone during charging may prevent or slow the rate of charge.\\n● Having multiple applications open on the phone while charging will reduce the charging efficiency, and may even shut down an application that is actively running (i.e. Apple CarPlay ® ). This may also cause the phone to overheat.\\n● Wireless chargers may implement certain methods to prevent the phone from overheating during charging such as slowing down the rate of charge. In certain instances, the device may shut down for a brief period of time (when the device reaches a certain temperature). If this happens, it does not mean there is a fault with the wireless charging pad.This may just be a protective measure to prevent damage to the phone.\\n● The use of multiple wireless functions at the same time (wireless charging, Apple CarPlay ® , Android Auto ™ ) could cause the device to overheat, resulting in limitation of the functions or it turning off. In this case, it is recommended to connect the system using the USB port.\\n● Do not place the key fob or any other type of metal/ magnetized object inside the mobile phone housing or near the wireless charging pad.\\n● With a compatible device placed on the charging pad, and the ignition is cycled to the OFF position, a reminder message may appear on the instrument cluster display to warn the driver.\\n\\nThe key fob should not be placed on the charging pad or within 6 inches (15 cm) of it. Doing so can cause excessive heat buildup and damage to the fob. Placing the fob in close proximity of the charging pad blocks the fob from being detected by the vehicle and prevents the vehicle from starting.'),\n",

       "\n",
       "1. Download the app: If you haven't already, download the mobile app provided by your car manufacturer from the Apple App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android). Ensure that your phone meets the system requirements specified in the app description.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Register your car: Follow the registration process within the app to link your vehicle with your smartphone account. This usually involves entering some identifying information about your car, such as its VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), and confirming your identity through a verification process.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Enable Bluetooth on your phone: Make sure that Bluetooth is enabled on your smartphone to establish a connection with the car's key fob or compatible module.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Pair your phone with the car: Open the app and follow the instructions to pair your smartphone with the car. This may involve scanning a QR code displayed in the car, entering a unique activation code sent to your phone, or using near-field communication (NFC) to tap the phone against the car's key fob or module.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Unlock the car: Once your phone is paired with the car, you should be able to use it to lock and unlock the vehicle. To unlock the car, simply open the app and press the appropriate button within the app (usually represented by a car icon). You can also set up the app to allow for automatic unlocking when your phone is near the car or when you approach the vehicle with your phone in hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Important note: It's essential to keep your smartphone charged and the app updated to ensure that you can continue to use the keyless entry feature smoothly. Additionally, using your phone to unlock the car may not always be a substitute for having the physical key fob on hand; in some cases, it is still necessary to have the key fob to start the engine or access certain features of the vehicle. Always consult your car's owner's manual for specific instructions regarding the use of the smartphone app with your car model."
